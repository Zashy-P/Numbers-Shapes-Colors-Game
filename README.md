# Numbers-Shapes-Colors-Game
An educational game designed to teach pre-schoolers the fundementals of numbers, colors and shapes using the DrRacket programming language. This was made for our first semester CMPE 100 project.

If you will use DrRacket IDE instead of VSC or anything else:
- you wont need to type (require ..) you can just add the teachpack and that would be enough!
- also you dont have to type (test) because it automatically tests in DrRacket IDE!

# Numbers-Shapes-Colors-Game
A game that teaches children numbers, colors and shapes using the DrRacket programming language. This was made as our first semester's university project.

If you will use DrRacker IDE instead of VSC or anything else:
- you wont need to type (require ..) you can just add the teachpack and that would be enough!
- also you dont have to type (test) because it automatically tests in DrRacket IDE!
